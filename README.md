  <p><em>Home Assistant integration for Tecnosystemi Pico devices</em></p>
</div>


Hassio Open Pico is a Home Assistant integration that enables management of Pico devices (manufactured by Tecnosystemi) through Home Assistant.

This integration provides monitoring, control, and automation capabilities for Pico devices, offering an intuitive interface for Home Assistant users.

This integration took inspiration from:
- The official [Tecnosystemi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.tecnosystemi.TS&hl=it) mobile application
- My own reverse engineered POC mobile application [Open Pico](https://github.com/VoidElle/open-pico-app)

## Installation 📦
### Via HACS (Recommended) ⭐
[![Open in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=VoidElle&repository=hassio-open-pico&category=integration)

### Via HACS (Manual)
1. Add custom repository:
   - Open HACS in your Home Assistant interface
    - Go to "Integrations" tab
    - Click on the three dots in the top right corner and select "Custom repositories"
    - Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/VoidElle/hassio-open-pico`
    - Select "Integration" as the category
    - Click "Add"


2. Install the integration:
   - In HACS Integrations, click + Explore & Download Repositories
   - Search for "Hassio Open Pico"
   - Click on the integration and then Download
   - Select the latest version and click Download


3. Restart Home Assistant 🔄

### Manual Installation 🔧
1. Copy the `custom_components/hassio_open_pico` folder to your `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration ⚙️
1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration" and search for "Hassio Open Pico"

## Limitations ⚠️
- Support only for Pico devices
